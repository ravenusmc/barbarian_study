# barbarian_study
## Intro

From time to time I like to look at quora.com and browse some of the questions
that people usually ask. Recently, as I was doing this, someone asked: Why
did the Romans never take over Germania. The individual who answered the question
gave a long response which I will not get into here. Just to say that in his
response he looked at data, from wikipedia, that showed how many battles the
Romans lost against the Germanic barbarians. Thus, I decided to web scrape this
data and make a simple project out of it.

The site that I will be web scraping is this one:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_Germanic_Wars
I'll focus on the table on the site.

This project will have two parts. The webscraping where I will build a csv file
from the data that I scrape. The second part will be making the actual web page
from the data that I scraped.
