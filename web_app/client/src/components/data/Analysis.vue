      <h2 class='font'>Brief Conclusion</h2>
      <p class='font'>
          The first major encounter with Germanic tribes was in -113 B.C.E with the
        Cimbri. The Romans were slowly expanding North and I believe that tribe
        was moving south. They were bound to collide. From there, the Romans really
        did not have that many engagements until about the middle of the third
        century. This could be cause the Roman empire, at this time, was in a
        state of crisis - a period known as the crisis of the third century. It
        almost seems that from this point forward it was nothing but Barbarians
        at the gate. The Romans have a lot of battles and at the same time having a
        lot of internal political problems.
          I also want to point out that it appears that from any given time period
        the Romans were only winning battles about 50% of the time. This is quite
        interesting to me. For I've always heard that Rome was a military machine
        but still it was only winning about 50% of the time against these tribes!
        That should tell anyone how much of a threat they were!
